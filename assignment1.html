<h1> Assignment #1</h1>
 
    <p>
      <b><span class="emph">Due on Oct. 5, 2011 at 23:59:59</span></b>
    </p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B over a packet-switched
	network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a digital 64kbps bit stream on the
	fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte packets. There is only one link between
	Host A and B; its transmission rate is 500 kbps and its propagation delay is 2 msec.
	As soon as Host A gather a packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives
	an entire packet, it converts the packet's bits into an analog signal. How much time
	elapses from the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A)
	until the bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)? </li>

	<li>Suppose users share a 1 Mbps link. Also suppose each user require 100 kbps when
	transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the time (statistical
			multiplexiing)
	<ol type="a">
		<li>When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported? </li>
		<li>For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find the
		probability that a given user is transmitting.</li>
		<li>Suppose there are 40 users. Find the probability that at any given time,
		exactly <i>n</i> users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: use the binomial
				distribution.) </li>
		<li>Find the probability that there are 11 or more users transmitting simultaneously. </li>
	</ol> </li>

	<li>Perform a Traceroute between source and destination on the same continent at three
	different hours of the day.
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Find the average and standard deviation of the round-trip delays at each of the
		three hours (e.g., 10 repeated experiments).
		</li><li>Find the number of routers in the path at each of the three hours. Did the paths
	   	change during any of the hours?
		</li><li>Try to identify the number of ISP networks that the Traceroute packets pass
		through from source to destination. Routers with similare names and/or similar IP
		addresses should be considered as part of the same ISP. In your experiments, do the
		largest delays occur at the peering interfaces between adjacent ISPs?
		</li><li>Repeat the above for a source and destination on different continents.
		Compare the intra-continent and inter-continent results.
	</li></ol> </li>

	<li>Compare and contrast WiFi wireless Internet access and 3G wireless Internet access.
	What are the bit rates of the two services? What are the costs? Discuss roaming and
	access ubiquity. </li>

	<li>Try to identify at least 3 applications that use plaint text password/identification method.
	    Use Wireshark to capture the plaint text password and write a report to describe how and where
		you found the passwords. You need to turnin packet dumps for this problem.  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Part 2: Network Commands Exercise</h2>

In this assignment, you will explore the various tools that an end user
can use to discover how a machine is connected to the network and what
the network looks like beyond the first hop.  You investigation
will use the following six tools:

<ol>
  <li> ifconfig
  </li>
  <li> arp
  </li>
  <li> traceroute
  </li>
  <li> netstat
  </li>
  <li> nslookup
  </li>
  <li> whois
  </li>
</ol>


<h3> Assignment Details</h3>


All of these tools should be available on any machine running a UNIX-based
operating system, i.e., the testbed.  However, unlike the other
assignments, you can do this assignment from any machine that has all
of these commands available.
<p>

You will want to make extensive use of the <i>man pages</i> for 
each command.</p>
<h4>1. ifconfig</h4>


<ol>
  <li> Run ``ifconfig -a'' on the machine you will be using.  Capture the
output, and identify and explain as much of what is printed as you can.
NOTE:  You should be able to understand almost all of it.</li>
  
</ol>


<h4>2. ARP</h4>


<ol>
  <li> How do you show the full ARP table for your machine?  Capture 
a printout of what it is.  Explain each column of what is printed.<br>
  </li>
  <li> If you try and use the <i>arp</i> command to add or delete an entry to the 
ARP table what happens? Why do you suppose this is the case?<br>
  </li>
  <li> You still have the ability to modify the ARP table, just not directly.
How can you affect (either add, delete, or change) entries in the ARP table? 
Use this mechanism to add at least two new hosts to the ARP table and include 
a printout.<br>
  </li>
  <li> How long do entries stay cached in the ARP table?  Describe a
trial-and-error method to discover the timeout value.<br>
  </li>
  <li> What will happen if two IP addresses map to the same Ethernet address?
Be specific on how all hosts on the subnet operate.</li>
</ol>


<h4>3. traceroute</h4>


<ol>
  <!-- <li> Explain in detail how <i>traceroute</i> works.<br> </li> -->

  <li> Perform a <i>traceroute</i> from your machine to <i>tourism.at.ru</i>. Include a copy
of the output and explain what happened including a description of what
each of the fields means.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Here's the challenge for this question:  we want to traceroute to a 
non-existant machine outside SJTU.  The first problem is how do we KNOW that a particular machine does
not exist?  If we just pick an IP address and <i>ping</i> it, why is that
not sufficient?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Determine an IP address for a machine that you know definitely does not exist.
Do a traceroute to that machine.  Include a copy of the result.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Identify a completely different (in all octets) IP address for a non-existant
machine.  Do a traceroute to this machine.  Include a copy of this result.</li>
  <li> Repeat the above exercise (but you don't have to include traceroutes to
more than two machines in your writeup) enough times so you can detect a 
pattern about what is happening.  What pattern exists and why?

  </li>
</ol>


<h4>4. netstat</h4>


<ol>
  <li> What is <i>netstat</i> and what is it used for?<br>
  </li>
  <li> What parameters for <i>netstat</i> should you use to show all the TCP 
connections established? Include a printout of this list for your machine.
Be sure to explain what all fields are.<br>
  </li>
  <li> What does <i>netstat -r</i> show? What are each of the fields in this
output?<br>
  </li>
  <li> <i>netstat</i> can be used to display network interface status. What option
of <i>netstat</i> does this? By using <i>netstat</i>, figure out the number of interfaces
on your machine.  In the output you will find an interface named <i>lo0</i>
as a loopback interface. Can you say anything about this interface, about
its function?</li>
</ol>


<h4>5. nslookup</h4>


<ol>
  <li> What is the IP address for the machine kubi.cs.berkeley.edu?<br>
  </li>
  <li> What <i>local</i> machine is this information coming from? Why is 
it coming from this machine?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Here is the problem: I want to find the IP address of where my email 
to somebody@hotmail.com goes. What you really need to do is find the 
``mail exchanger''
for hotmail.com. There is an option in nslookup that tells you what the mail
exchanger is for hotmail.com. Figure out the exact syntax of the format of
this command, and execute it. Now what is the IP address of where my email
to hotmail goes?</li>
</ol>


<h4>6. whois</h4>


<ul>
  <b>HINT:</b> You will need to use a different server than the default
whois server. One to try is: whois.arin.net.
  <p>

  <b>HINT:</b>  Getting whois.arin.net to return information is a challenge.
Make sure you try all combinations of the network name, the host address,
and the network address.</p>
  <p>

  <b>HINT:</b>  You can also do a domain search at someplace like
http://www.networksolutions.com/.</p>
</ul>


<ol>
  <li> Who is the ``coordinator'' for the network on which www.sjtu.edu.cn resides?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Who is the coordinator for the network that kubi.cs.berkeley.edu is on?<br>
  </li>
  <li> Like the hotmail example, I have another friend I send email to at AOL.
Her email address is something@aol.com.  What can you say about
the coordinator for the AOL email network, i.e. contact info, etc?
Include information about the steps you took and the
results of the queries you made to figure out this information.<br>
  </li>
  <li> What machine has IP address 198.182.196.56?   What machines act
as the DNS nameserver for the domain that 198.182.196.56 is in?</li>
</ol>
