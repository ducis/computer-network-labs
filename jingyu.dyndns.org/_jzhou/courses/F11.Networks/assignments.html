<p><a href="https://jingyu.dyndns.org/~jzhou/courses/F11.Networks/assignments/faq.html">Frequently asked questions</a> on Linux and assignments.</p>

<h2>Submitting Assignments</h2>

<p>We'll use the <a href="https://jingyu.dyndns.org/~jzhou/courses/testbed.html">Linux testbed</a> for all programming assignments.
You will use the <span class="code">turnin</span> program for submission, e.g.,
<pre>
	$ turnin homework1@course file1 file2 dir1 ...
</pre>
</p>

<p>To make sure you have turned in the corrected files, you can also checkout the
files submitted to the system, e.g., the files turned in using the above command:
<pre>
	$ checkout homework1@course dir_to_store_file_checked_out
</pre>
</p>


<h2>Collaboration</h2>

<p>
Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process.
Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
friends are encouraged.  However, when the time comes to write the
code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer
appropriate; the program must be your own work.
</p>

<p>
Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's program. 
Writing code for use by another or
using another's code in any form is academic fraud and will be dealt
with harshly. You are also responsible for ensuring that the code you
write for the assignments is not readable by others.
