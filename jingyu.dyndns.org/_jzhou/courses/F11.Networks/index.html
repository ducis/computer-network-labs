<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is a undergraduate course in computer networks.  The goals are:
<ul>
 <li>To understand network protocols, network architecture, and networked systems.</li>
 <li>To study on basic network programming problems and learn to engage in basic networking research.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The past few years have seen a remarkable growth in the global
network infrastructure. The Internet has grown from a research
curiosity to something we all take for granted.
How does this network infrastructure work?  What are the design principles
upon which it is based, and how are those principles applied in practice?
How can we make the Internet work better today?  We will examine these
issues and more during the course.
</p>

<p>
This class covers a wide range of network-related topics, including network hardware,
network protocols, network tools, applications, security, and social issues.
Students are expected to understand principles and technologies that make Internet
a reality.  Through labs, students will become familier with some network devices
and network protocols. More importantly, assignments will cover basic network
programming and networked/distributed systems.
</p>
